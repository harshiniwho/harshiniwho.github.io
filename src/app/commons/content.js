    about: "My name is pronounced as easy as my pronouns - her/she-nee. I am a software engineer currently working at Visa Inc. I have had experience working on a little bit of everything in the domain of computer science, primarily being a backend engineer. When I am not stealing code from stackoverflow, I am usually lost in a book or trying to capture my world in words. \n Check out my feminism corner for stories I think you should hear about. Feel free to reach out to me on the intersection of women, coding and books!",
